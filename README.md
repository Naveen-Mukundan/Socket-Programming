# Socket-Programming


  Socket Programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

     1) The program contains two files, each for client and server. 
     2) Open two terminals or two windows in Python GUI.
     3) Run the server code first in one terminal or window.
     4) Execute the client code in another terminal or window.
